    <h3>Tips For Saving Water</h3>
    
    <p>Turn off the tap when you brush your teeth – this can save 6 litres of water per minute.</p>
    <p>Take a shorter shower. Showers can use anything between 6 and 45 litres per minute. Consider getting an aerated shower head, which combines water and air, or inserting a regulator in your shower, which puts an upper limit on flow rates..</p>
    <p>Always use full loads in your washing machine and dishwasher – this cuts out unnecessary washes in between.</p>
    <p>Fix a dripping tap. A dripping tap can waste 15 litres of water a day, or 5,500 litres of water a year.</p>
    <p>Install a water meter. When you're paying your utility provider for exactly how much water you use, laid out in an itemised bill, there's an incentive to waste less of the stuff.</p>
